# What Counts as a Recommendation
A recommendation is:
- An actionable suggestion for improvement, change, or future action
- Advice on what should or could be done differently
- A proposal for a specific approach, policy, or practice
- A request for something to be added, removed, or modified
- Constructive feedback that implies "we/you/they should do X"

Examples of recommendations:
- "The training should include more hands-on exercises"
- "I suggest we cover advanced topics in a separate session"
- "It would be helpful to provide reference materials afterward"
- "Consider adding more time for Q&A"

---

# What Does NOT Count as a Recommendation
- General positive/negative statements without actionable content ("It was great", "I didn't like it")
- Pure descriptions of current state without suggesting change
- Questions without implied suggestions
- Purely personal preferences without actionable proposals

---

# Key Rules
- Use only the information **explicitly present** in the comment.
- DO NOT infer unstated recommendations or read between the lines.
- DO NOT count vague dissatisfaction as a recommendation unless it includes a clear actionable suggestion.
- Identify **all distinct** recommendations in the comment.
- Each recommendation must correspond to a specific identifiable excerpt.
- If multiple recommendations appear in one sentence, extract them as separate items if they suggest different actions.
- If the comment is purely descriptive, observational, or expresses sentiment without actionable content, return has_recommendations: false.

# Qualifier Types (Direction of Change)

For each recommendation, assign one **qualifier** from the list below based on the intended action:

| Qualifier | Meaning | Example Phrases | Example |
|------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **add_or_increase** | Suggests adding or increasing something | "Add", "Include", "More", "Increase" | "Add more examples" |

    Generate a prompt to detect and categorize alerts from employee comments.

    Alerts are serious concerns, complaints, or reports of problematic situations
    that require attention from HR, management, or compliance teams.
    """
    return f"""
You are an expert text analyzer specializing in workplace safety and compliance. You are analyzing an employee comment from a post-training survey.
The goal is to identify whether the comment contains **alerts** — serious concerns, complaints, or reports of problematic workplace situations that require immediate attention or follow-up from HR, management, or compliance teams.

**Comment**: {text}

---

# What Counts as an Alert
An alert is:
- A report or complaint about discrimination, harassment, or hostile behavior
- A concern about safety, violence, or threatening situations
- A description of ethical violations, fraud, or policy breaches
- A disclosure of mental health crises or substance abuse issues
- A report of retaliation for protected activities
- Any serious workplace concern that could expose the organization to legal, safety, or reputational risk

Examples of alerts:
- "My manager makes inappropriate comments about my appearance"
- "I witnessed someone being excluded from meetings because of their race"
- "There's a safety hazard in the warehouse that hasn't been addressed"
- "I was told not to report the incident or I'd lose my job"
- "A colleague threatened me after I disagreed with them"

---

# What Does NOT Count as an Alert
- General complaints about workload, stress, or job satisfaction (unless they indicate serious mental health crisis)
- Constructive feedback or improvement suggestions (these are recommendations, not alerts)
- Minor interpersonal conflicts without harassment or discrimination elements
- General dissatisfaction with training, management style, or policies (unless indicating serious violations)
- Requests for resources or process improvements

---

# Key Rules
- Use only the information **explicitly present** in the comment.
- DO NOT infer alerts from vague dissatisfaction — there must be clear indication of a serious concern.
- DO NOT escalate routine complaints into alerts unless they describe genuinely problematic situations.
- Identify **all distinct** alerts in the comment.
- Each alert must correspond to a specific identifiable excerpt.
- If multiple distinct concerns appear, extract them as separate alert items.
- If the comment contains only routine feedback or minor complaints, return has_alerts: false.
- **Be especially vigilant** for subtle indicators of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation that may be worded indirectly.

---

# Alert Types

For each alert, assign one **alert_type** from the list below:

| Alert Type | Description | Example Indicators |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **discrimination** | Unfair treatment based on protected characteristics (race, gender, age, religion, disability, etc.) | "treated differently because of", "excluded due to", "overlooked for promotion because I'm" |
| **sexual_harassment** | Unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical harassment of a sexual nature | "inappropriate comments about appearance", "unwanted touching", "sexual jokes", "asked me out repeatedly" |
| **workplace_violence** | Physical violence, threats of violence, or intimidating behavior | "threatened", "physical altercation", "afraid for my safety", "aggressive behavior" |
| **safety_concern** | Hazardous conditions, unsafe practices, or violations of safety protocols | "unsafe equipment", "no safety training", "hazardous materials", "accident waiting to happen" |
| **ethical_violation** | Fraud, corruption, misuse of company resources, or violations of ethical standards | "falsified records", "misused funds", "asked to lie", "cover up" |
| **hostile_environment** | Pervasive pattern of intimidation, ridicule, or offensive conduct that creates an abusive atmosphere | "constantly belittled", "toxic atmosphere", "everyone gangs up on", "culture of fear" |
| **retaliation** | Adverse action taken against someone for reporting concerns or exercising legal rights | "punished for speaking up", "demoted after complaining", "told not to report" |
| **bullying** | Repeated mistreatment, verbal abuse, or deliberate sabotage by colleagues or supervisors | "constantly criticized in front of others", "undermined my work", "publicly humiliated" |
| **substance_abuse** | Concerns about drug or alcohol use affecting workplace safety or performance | "came to work intoxicated", "using drugs on site", "impaired while operating equipment" |
| **mental_health_crisis** | Indicators of severe mental distress, self-harm risk, or crisis requiring immediate support | "thinking about ending it all", "can't go on", "severe depression", "suicidal thoughts" |
| **data_breach** | Unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of confidential information | "customer data exposed", "security protocols violated", "leaked confidential information" |
| **fraud** | Intentional deception for financial or personal gain | "stealing from company", "fake invoices", "embezzlement", "kickback scheme" |
| **other_serious_concern** | Any other serious workplace issue requiring urgent attention that doesn't fit other categories | Various situations requiring escalation |

---

# Severity Levels

For each alert, assign a **severity** level:

| Severity | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **low** | Minor concerns that should be documented but don't require immediate action |
| **moderate** | Concerns requiring timely follow-up and investigation |
| **high** | Serious issues requiring prompt attention and intervention |
| **critical** | Imminent threats to safety, ongoing criminal activity, or situations requiring immediate response |

Guidelines:
- **sexual_harassment**, **discrimination**, **workplace_violence**, **retaliation**: Usually moderate to critical depending on specifics
- **mental_health_crisis** with self-harm indicators: Critical
- **safety_concern** with imminent danger: High to critical
- **bullying**, **hostile_environment**: Typically moderate to high
- Use context clues about severity, frequency, and impact

# Output Format
Return a JSON object with:
- **has_alerts**: Boolean (true if at least one alert is present, false otherwise)
- **alerts**: List of objects, each containing:
    * **excerpt**: The exact text span from the comment containing the alert.

You are an expert text analyzer. You are analyzing an employee comment from a post-training survey that has been classified under a specific topic path.

**Comment**: {text}

**Topic Path**: {stem_path}

{definitions_section}---

# Your Task
Determine the overall polarity (sentiment) of the comment specifically toward this topic path. The comment has already been classified as relevant to this topic. Now, identify whether the author's stance toward this specific topic is positive, negative, neutral, or mixed.

Use the topic definitions above to understand what each level of the path represents and ensure your polarity assessment is aligned with the actual meaning of the topic.

---

# Polarity Types

| Polarity | Meaning | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Positive** | Expresses satisfaction, praise, approval, or positive sentiment toward the topic | "Great explanations", "Very helpful", "Loved this aspect", "Excellent approach" |
| **Negative** | Expresses dissatisfaction, criticism, disapproval, or negative sentiment toward the topic | "Poor explanations", "Confusing", "Needs improvement", "Didn't like this" |
| **Neutral** | Factual observation or description without clear positive or negative sentiment | "The class covered this topic", "Explanations were provided", "This was included" |
| **Mixed** | Contains both positive and negative sentiments toward the same topic | "Good examples but too fast", "Clear but too technical", "Helpful but needs more" |

---

# Key Rules
- Assess polarity **only for this specific topic path**, not the overall comment
- Distinguish between constructive criticism (Negative) and balanced feedback (Mixed)
- If the comment mentions both strengths and weaknesses about the topic, classify as Mixed
- Pure suggestions for improvement without negative sentiment should be Negative (constructive criticism)
- Expressions of gratitude or appreciation are Positive even if brief
- If the comment is purely descriptive without evaluative language, classify as Neutral
- Provide a confidence score from 1 (low) to 5 (high) for your assessment
- Extract the specific excerpt that best supports your polarity determination

---

# Output Format
Return a JSON object with:
- **has_polarity**: Boolean (true if polarity can be determined, false otherwise)
- **polarity_result**: Object containing (only if has_polarity is true):
    * **polarity**: One of: "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", "Mixed"
    * **confidence**: Integer from 1 to 5 indicating confidence in the assessment
    * **reasoning**: One sentence explaining why this polarity was assigned to this topic

    """
    return f"""
You are an expert text analyzer. You are analyzing an employee comment from a post-training survey.
The goal is to identify whether the comment contains **trends** — statements that indicate change or stability over time — and to characterize both the **direction** and **valence** (positive/negative nature) of each trend.

**Comment**: {text}

---

# What Counts as a Trend
A trend is a statement that indicates:
- A temporal comparison between past and present states
- An observation of change (or consistency) over time
- An evolution or trajectory of some aspect

**Trends require temporal markers** such as:
- Explicit time references: "last year", "in 2023", "this quarter", "recently"
- Comparative language: "used to be", "no longer", "has become", "still"
- Change verbs: "improved", "declined", "increased", "decreased", "remains"
- Sequential language: "now", "anymore", "these days", "currently"

Examples of trends:
- "My manager used to be caring, but not anymore" (declining)
- "The quality has improved significantly since last year" (improving)
- "Training remains excellent as always" (stable/positive)
- "Support has been inconsistent lately" (fluctuating)

---

# What Does NOT Count as a Trend
- **Static descriptions** without temporal comparison: "The training is good"
- **Comparisons to expectations** (not temporal): "This was worse than I expected"
- **Recommendations for future**: "We should improve this" (use recommendations detection instead)
- **One-time events**: "The last session was cancelled" (no pattern/trajectory)

---

# Key Rules
- Use only the information **explicitly present** in the comment.
- A trend **requires** at least a moderate temporal marker (explicit or clearly implicit).
- DO NOT infer trends from purely static statements.
- Identify **all distinct** trends in the comment.
- Each trend must correspond to a specific identifiable excerpt.
- If multiple trends appear, extract them as separate items if they describe different aspects or directions.

---

# Direction Types

For each trend, assign one **direction** from the list below:

| Direction | Meaning | Example Temporal Markers | Example |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------|---------|
| **increasing** | Something is growing, rising, or expanding | "has increased", "more than before", "growing" | "Workload has increased significantly" |
| **decreasing** | Something is shrinking, falling, or contracting | "has decreased", "less than before", "declining" | "Support has declined over time" |
| **improving** | Something is getting better in quality/effectiveness | "has improved", "better than", "getting better" | "Communication has improved recently" |
| **deteriorating** | Something is getting worse in quality/effectiveness | "has worsened", "worse than", "getting worse" | "Morale has deteriorated since the changes" |
| **stable_positive** | Something good remains consistent | "still excellent", "remains strong", "consistently good" | "Quality remains excellent" |
| **stable_negative** | Something bad remains consistent | "still poor", "remains weak", "consistently bad" | "Response time is still slow" |
| **fluctuating** | Something varies or is inconsistent over time | "inconsistent", "varies", "sometimes...sometimes" | "Feedback has been hit or miss lately" |

---

# Valence Types

For each trend, assign one **valence** indicating whether the change/state is viewed positively or negatively:

| Valence | Meaning | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **positive** | The trend is favorable, beneficial, or desirable | Improvements, positive stability, decrease in negative things |
| **negative** | The trend is unfavorable, problematic, or undesirable | Deterioration, negative stability, increase in negative things |
| **neutral** | The trend is neither clearly good nor bad | Factual observations without evaluative content |
| **mixed** | The trend has both positive and negative aspects | Fluctuating quality, or context suggests ambivalence |

**Important**: Valence should be determined from the **commenter's perspective** as expressed in the text.

---

# Confidence Scoring

For each trend, assign a **confidence score** from 1 to 5:

| Score | Meaning | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **5** | Very certain | Explicit temporal markers, clear change, unambiguous direction |
| **4** | Quite certain | Strong temporal indicators, clear trend with minor ambiguity |
| **3** | Moderately certain | Temporal markers present but trend requires some interpretation |
| **2** | Somewhat uncertain | Weak temporal markers or ambiguous direction/valence |
| **1** | Very uncertain | Minimal temporal indicators, highly ambiguous interpretation |

**Confidence Guidelines**:
- Higher confidence for explicit time references ("since 2023", "compared to last year")
- Lower confidence for vague temporal markers ("recently", "these days")
- Higher confidence when direction and valence are both clear
- Lower confidence when trend is implied rather than stated

# What Counts as a Trend
A trend for this topic path is a statement that indicates:
- A temporal comparison between past and present states **of this topic**
- An observation of change (or consistency) over time **regarding this topic**
- An evolution or trajectory **of some aspect of this topic**

**Trends require temporal markers** such as:
- Explicit time references: "last year", "in 2023", "this quarter", "recently"
- Comparative language: "used to be", "no longer", "has become", "still"
- Change verbs: "improved", "declined", "increased", "decreased", "remains"
